       <h2> Overview</h2>
      <center> <pre><b>
The Examination Branch (EB) was established from the inception of Anurag Engineering College to undertake various examination-related functions. The Anurag Engineering College has been granted Autonomous status by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in the 2014 academic year. EB progressively transitioned from affiliation activities to autonomous activities. The EB keeps track of the studentsâ€™ examination data. In accordance with the academic calendar, the EB announces various examinations, collects fees from eligible students for conducting the semester end examinations, prepares timetables, assigns invigilation duties, conducts frisking to prevent malpractice, evaluates answer scripts, processes results, declares results, and prints certificates etc. The EB is fully automated. Every year EB conducts Graduation Day. EB is associated with a team of teaching and non-teaching employees. Each department appoints one faculty member to handle examination-related activities in their respective departments. The Controller of Examinations (CoE) leads the Examination Branch. The Principal is Chief Controller of the Examinations. An automated tool is used for handling various forms of data in the EB.
